## project setup instructions
I have done three projects 
1.grade.js works by using the computed input to calculate the grade of a student
2.speed.js calculates demerit points for users when they have passed the speed limit when one inputs their speed, it will calculate their demerit points in relation to the speed limit
3.salcalc.js computes the users, NSSF deductions, NHIF deductions, PAYE and net salary when the user inputs their basic salaries and their deductions
